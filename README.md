# Snake-Game

## Project 20 & 21 of 100 Days of Code
- Used python Turtle library to create the classic snake game
- Implemented event listeners and object oriented programming
- User directs the snake by pressing the arrow keys
- Food is randomly placed on the screen
- When snake runs into food the food piece disappears and the snake body gets longer
- Scoreboard tracks successful collision with food
- If snake runs into the wall or its own tail the user looses the game
